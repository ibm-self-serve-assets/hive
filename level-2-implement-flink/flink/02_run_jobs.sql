-- =============================================================================
-- STEP 2 of 2: start the jobs  (run this ONCE, as a single statement)
-- =============================================================================
--
-- WHAT THIS DOES
--   Starts one continuous Flink statement that runs three jobs, one each for
--   gathering, manufacturing and assembly. Each job pairs a "started" event with
--   its "completed" event and writes the time between them to `calculated_values`.
--
-- BEFORE YOU RUN
--   * Step 1 (01_create_sink.sql) has been run.
--   * Same SQL workspace context as Step 1 (catalog, database, compute pool).
--   * Click "+" to create a new SQL cell below, paste this entire file, and click Run.
--   * The EXECUTE STATEMENT SET ... BEGIN ... END block bundles all three stage
--     jobs into a single continuous statement.
--   * Once it reaches "Running", you can delete (trash icon) the cell card to keep
--     your workspace clean; the job continues running 24/7 in the background.
--
-- HOW EACH JOB WORKS
--   1. The server publishes plain JSON, so Flink sees `key` and `val` as raw
--      bytes. CAST(`val` AS STRING) safely ensures string type for JSON_VALUE.
--   2. A started event and a completed event belong together when their
--      payload.job_id is equal. Probe events (connection.test) have no job_id,
--      so they never match and are ignored.
--   3. The join only looks for a completed event from 5 seconds before to
--      1 minute after the started event (Kafka record time). Jobs normally
--      take 5-15 s, so this keeps Flink's memory small. A started event with no
--      completed event in that window produces no row.
--      If you slow the simulation down so jobs take over a minute, widen the
--      "+ INTERVAL '1' MINUTE" bound.
--
-- WHAT THE OUTPUT NUMBERS MEAN
--   elapsed_sim_minutes  completed.sim_time_minutes - started.sim_time_minutes.
--                        Exact sim-time difference in minutes. 1 real second = 1
--                        sim minute, so this equals elapsed wall seconds.
--   elapsed_wall_s       real seconds between the two occurred_at timestamps.
--
-- Only values from the events themselves are used (no NOW(), UUID(), RAND()),
-- so replaying the same events gives the same rows.
--
-- Event fields used (see spec-shared/schemas/event_payloads.json):
--   envelope : factory_id, run_id, occurred_at, sim_time_minutes
--   payload  : job_id, resource_id / station_id / output_id
