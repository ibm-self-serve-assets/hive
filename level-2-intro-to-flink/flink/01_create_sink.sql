-- =============================================================================
-- STEP 1 of 2: create the output table  (run this ONCE, as a single statement)
-- =============================================================================
--
-- WHAT THIS DOES
--   Creates the `hive_job_durations` table. Flink will fill it in Step 2 with one row
--   per finished job: how long it took between its "started" and "completed"
--   events.
--
-- BEFORE YOU RUN
--   * In your SQL Workspace header, set "Use catalog" to hive_dev, "Use database"
--     to your Kafka cluster, and select your active Flink compute pool.
--   * Paste this file into a workspace cell and click Run.
--
-- NOTES
--   * Flink creates the backing Kafka topic `hive_job_durations` for you. Do not
--     create that topic yourself (for example with provision_topics.py).
--   * 'json-registry' stores the table's schema in Schema Registry. Schema
--     Registry must be enabled for the environment, and Tableflow needs the
--     registered schema.
--   * 'changelog.mode' = 'append' means every row is a new, final fact (never
--     updated or deleted). Tableflow remembers this mode after its first
--     materialization and it cannot be changed later, so pick it up front.
